## General Guidelines

- **Framework**: Use the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) as the primary framework, leveraging its modular and model-agnostic capabilities.

- **Language**: Write the codebase in Python, as ADK supports pip install google-adk for Python-based development.

- **Modularity**: Design the system as a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for distinct tasks (e.g., question generation, response simulation, script formatting).

- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with the Google ecosystem (e.g., Gemini models) but maintain model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic principles.

- **Safety and Security**: Implement ADK's safety and security best practices to ensure trustworthy agent behavior.

  

## System Requirements

- **Objective**: Develop a multi-agent system that generates realistic simulated interview scripts based on Motivational Interviewing.
- **Input**: Accept arguments such as session objective, reference material, description of client's problem to customize the interview script.
- **Output**: Generate a structured interview script in markdown format, including three agents' contribution.
- **Agents**:
  - **Therapist Agent**: Generates relevant interview questions to motivate the client and lead the whole interview.
  - **Client Agent**: Simulates realistic responses based on his own problem and situational context.
  - **Supervisor Agent**: Give supervision to the therapist agent to improve the quality of interview
- **Tools**: Use ADK's pre-built tools (e.g., Search for industry context) and custom functions for response generation and formatting.
- **Important**: Before coding, thoroughly read every page under https://google.github.io/adk-docs/ to familiarize yourself with the syntax and style of how to code the agent, and then start the actual coding.

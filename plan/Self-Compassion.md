# Self-Compassion

First step...some empathy, compassion for ourselves, and validation: It makes sense this is hard for you. If change were easy, there wouldn't be a million resources (like this one) to help you. And in the moments you struggle with it, you are not alone. There is a universe of us, all out there working on positive change and struggling together. This is what those who study self- compassion call "common humanity." When you're kind to yourself and realistic about the inevitable pitfalls you'll encounter on your change journey, you can move forward toward your goals—and forgive yourself for the lapses along the way. When you show yourself compassion, particularly in moments of struggle, you can step back and feel that change is seriously hard, and there is no magic bullet. It's just the process of applying yourself, with patience and self- compassion, over and over again—using all that's important to you, your values and dreams, and all that you have, like the people who love and care for you, to help you along the way—and doing the best you can from one moment to the next.

For instance, I sit here typing when I probably "should\* be spending more "quality time" with my daughter. Being a mindful, attentive parent is something that is super important to me. I could sit here and beat myself up for choosing to write instead- - What is wrong with you, Drapkin?- or I could turn my empathy and compassion skills on myself, choose to be kind to myself, and move forward toward living my values and reaching toward my goals. You are writing a book that is consistent with your meaning and purpose, and you can find time later for your other important values, including being a mindful parent. I will "be here now" and then later today do something with my daughter. That sounds way easier than it is, even for an "expert" like me. And it is possible. By being aware of your values (what really motivates you to make the changes you hope to make), the secrets of behavior change, and how to self- compassionately navigate challenges to behavior change as they arise, you can get to where you want to go.

We're going to talk more about that values stuff in a minute, but first, I want to offer you some skills to deflect the "f\*ck its" and the self- criticism, which most of us are quite good at generating! So, let's try out our first skill- - turning our kindness, empathy, and compassion, which we can so often and easily deploy with others, on ourselves. This is a tool you'll pull out of your toolbox often- - especially when you beat yourself up for, well, being human.

# EXERCISE: Self-Compassion Break

Let's start by thinking of a change you are considering making, something you have been meaning to change, wanting to change, something you just haven't gotten right yet. Maybe it's the reason you have this book or maybe it's one of many change behaviors you have in mind. Bring it up in your mind and take a moment to see if you can feel it in your body, noticing where the struggle and distress show up. Really take a moment to notice the thoughts, the feelings, the sensations that this brings up for you in your mind and your body. (Yes, our bodies often show us when and where we feel stress, pain, or joy. For instance, when I'm stressed, I often notice it in my chest. It feels like I'm sucking air. Right now, even, I just noticed I wasn't breathing.) So, breathe and notice...

Now, with this source of your struggles in mind, turn your kindness to yourself. We can be skilled at being nice and gentle and patient with others, yet we tend to be very hard on ourselves. So, first, take those skills and say to yourself...

This is tough (or This is a struggle or Ooof, this is rough or This is stressful or This is frustrating or This is scary or whatever works for you).

This is the skill of mindfulness, awareness of the moment, acknowledging how hard this change process can be.

Next, say to yourself, Struggling is a part of life or Other people also struggle with change or I am not alone or Change is hard for everyone.

That's what we refer to as "common humanity," acknowledging that this struggle is a part of life for all of us. You are not alone here or ever, really. It feels that way sometimes, and part of this journey is realizing that struggle is part of life. We are all in this together.

I encourage you to remember this and feel this empathy for yourself often and whenever you need it.

The next step is to find a "soothing touch" for yourself. This is your soothing touch, so do whatever works for you. Try different forms of touch until you find what comforts you. Some people put a hand or both hands over their heart or a soft hand on their cheek or even put both arms across their chest in a "self- hug" kind of gesture. Or, maybe a fist to your chest in a sign of strength. When I first did this, with my hands over my heart, I felt silly—and now I love how it's my secret little way to send myself some kindness and gentleness when I need it, even in a room filled with people. It might feel wonky at first—and, trust me, it can have value.

When you find a personal soothing touch to try out, say to yourself: May I be gentle with myself or May I be kind to myself.

Also consider asking yourself, What do I need to hear right now to be gentler and kinder to myself? What would I want from a loving friend or family member? What would be helpful to hear right now?

Often, while it can be hard to be kind to ourselves, we know exactly what to say to our friends to help them feel better. If you can treat yourself the way you'd treat a friend or child or puppy, it can help.

Other ideas:

May I be patient with myself.

May I forgive myself.

May I learn to accept myself and this process for what it is.

Take a moment and observe what this was like for you. What did you notice? What did you learn? Maybe jot some notes down to capture your thoughts and insights if that feels helpful to you.

Consider using this Self- Compassion Break any time of day or night when you are struggling. Remind yourself to notice the moment, be kind to yourself, and remember that you are not alone—struggle like the kind you're feeling is part of life. You may find me with my hand over my heart and you will now know I'm trying to give myself a break, taking a moment to be gentler, kinder to myself so that I can be strong and effective. Rest assured, we will come back to this again when we need to.

That said, maybe the Self- Compassion Break feels too "squishy" for you to seem useful. That's cool. Again, we're here to find tools and strategies that will work for you. And let's align on this point: this journey we are embarking on is not always going to be easy; you'll want to be kind to yourself along the way, even if an explicit Self- Compassion Break doesn't always feel like the right way to practice that kindness.

Story time: How do farmers coax their donkeys to carry their goods to the town square? Well, you can beat Mr. Donkey with a stick to get him moving and keep beating him to keep him moving until he arrives at the town square. After years, that donkey will be beat up, tired, and

worn out. Or, you can be sweet to Mr. Donkey: "Come on, fella, let's do this... I know you're tired and I need you to work with me. One step at a time" and give him some carrots to help nourish him and motivate him to keep moving. After years, the donkey you gave carrots to will be happy, healthy, and cared for (and have amazing eyesight).*

You may have heard this carrot/stick metaphor for how we motivate other people (and donkeys). It applies no less to yourself. Even if the outcome is the same whether we use a carrot or a stick, whether we're kind to ourselves or not (that is, the donkey makes it to the town square, and we get to the positive change we are seeking), wouldn't it be awesome- if we weren't beaten down when we arrived? Use the carrots of kindness, patience, and self- compassion on yourself even when that mean, disparaging voice inside your head- - your inner critic- - starts grumbling and wants you to use the stick.

Now that we've got the self- compassion foundation laid down, let's move to another helpful foundational component in your change journey: stabilizing yourself.
